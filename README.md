# CHIP-8 Emulator written in AssemblyScript

This project was created to deal with the creation of an emulator in more detail
and to use [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org) for the first time. Various sources recommend to
implement CHIP-8 as the first emulator, due to the manageable complexity.

I have documented all steps of this project in detail [here](https://github.com/digitsensitive/chip8-wasm/blob/master/PROJECT.md) to guarantee
reproducibility as well as high quality.
