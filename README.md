# A CHIP-8 interpreter (and virtualÂ machine) written in AssemblyScript

This project was created to deal with the creation of an interpreter in more detail
and to use [AssemblyScript](https://www.assemblyscript.org) for the first time.

I have documented and described the development of the project in detail on the
following [article on Medium](https://medium.com/p/2e7c8749031d/edit).

Have fun reading through and coding!
