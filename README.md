# A CHIP-8 interpreter (and virtual machine) written in C++ with SDL2 and WebAssembly

This project was created to deal with the creation of an interpreter in more detail
and to use [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) for the first time.

I have documented and described the development of the project in detail on the
following [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@digit.sensitivee/how-i-created-my-first-interpreter-2e7c8749031d).

Have fun reading through and coding!

# Prerequisites

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- Install the [C++ extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
- Install the [Clang-Format extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xaver.clang-format)
- Install [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) and ensure it is installed `clang --version`
- Get the [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html)
- In the root directory set the CMAKE Toolchain file by running: `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/**/Emscripten.cmake` Ensure you update your path with the location of your emsdk installation location

# Code formatter

Use of [ClangFormat](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html). The style options are defined in the `.clang-format` file. For more details have a look at the official [Style Options](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html).

# Emscripten Compiler

The Emscripten Compiler Frontend (em++ f√ºr C++) is used to call the
Emscripten compiler from the command line.
For more details about the arguments look at the official
[Emscripten Compiler Frontend Reference](https://emscripten.org/docs/tools_reference/emcc.html#emcc-o2)
