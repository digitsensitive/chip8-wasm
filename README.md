# CHIP-8 Emulator written in AssemblyScript

This project was created to deal with the creation of an emulator in more detail
and to use AssemblyScript for the first time. Various sources recommend to
implement CHIP-8 as the first emulator, due to the manageable complexity.

I have documented all steps of this project in detail here to guarantee
reproducibility as well as high quality.
